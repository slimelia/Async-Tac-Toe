# Async-Tac-Toe
Asynchronous Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs entirely within the browser.

[Click HERE to play](https://slimelia.github.io/Async-Tac-Toe/)

The entire game is stored in a single HTML file and thus can run offline. (This would require manually pasting the URL parameter as an alternative input format for offline play has not been implemented.)

This is a proof-of-concept for asynchronous, serverless[^1] gameplay. The concept can be expanded to any turn-based game one could play in a browser; this concept could be used for chess. I didn't make chess because it would have taken longer. And I don't like chess. Sorry to all the chess-heads out there.
***
[^1]: *Technically* can be run serverless, but the HTML page has been hosted for convenience. No server-side processing needs to take place aside from serving the HTML file.
